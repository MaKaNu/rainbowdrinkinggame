The Rainbow Drinking Game is a real life DLC for the shooting game "Rainbow Six Siege" from Ubisoft. But it could also be "installed" to every 5-man-squad shooting game.

In general this DLC is compatible with a lot of other games but the rules and the application are specific invented for "Rainbow Six Siege". Feel free to contribute and use the application for other games.

## Basics

The game is really simple. Each Player has to take sips or shots for different events which will happen during the shooting game. A few events have to be applied ad hoc while others would be applied after each round. And one special Event after a hole game. One Player will be the Statistic Accountant. This Player is responsible for entering the sips and shots into the app.

### Events ad hoc

| Event | Result |
|-------|--------|
| teamkill | 1 shot |
| selfkill | 1 shot |
| teamdamage | 1 sip per 10 HP |
| trigger a "Frost Trap" | 1 shot? |
| trigger a "Kapkan Trap" | 3 sips |
| shot at "Alibi Gemini" | 1 sip |
| get roasted by enemy | 1 sip |
| get "Fuzed" | 1 sip |
| die by "Twitch drone" | 1 shot |
| die by "Maestro cam" | 3 sips |
| get interrogated by "Caveira" | 3 sips |
| lose your drone to "Mozzie" | 1 sip |
| lose your "Twitch drone" to "Mozzie" | 3 sips |
| "IQ" screams | 1 sip for every player |
| getting spawn killed | 3-5 sips |
| getting killed if you try to spawnkill | 1 shot |

Every player who applies these Events is responsible to apply them ad hoc and tries as good as possible to remeber the count of sips/shots until the end of a round.

## Events after each Round

After each round every player has the possibility to distribute the kills taken in the round as sips to the other players.

If a player scores an Ace, **every** other player takes a **shot**.

If a player has successfully planted the bomb he can distribute **3** additional **sips**.

If a player achieves successfully a spawnkill he can distribute **3** additional **sips**.

The Accountant ask the player for the result of the event which are applied ad hoc in the recently ended round and enters the values into the app.

### Special Event After a Game

If the Players lose a Game and are unable to win at least one round, each player take 5 sips.
